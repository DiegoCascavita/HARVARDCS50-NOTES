## CS50 Notes and Assignments

This repository contains my notes and completed homework assignments from the Harvard University course CS50.

### About the course

CS50 is an introductory course to computer science that covers fundamental concepts such as algorithms, data structures, memory, programming in C and Python, and more. The course also focuses on computational thinking and the development of practical skills in problem-solving and programming.

### Repository contents

In this repository, you will find my notes and completed homework assignments from the course, organized by topic and assignment. I have also included some additional code files and useful resources that I found helpful in my learning.

### Using this repository

If you are also taking CS50 or are simply interested in learning more about computer science, feel free to explore this repository and review my work. If you wish to use any of my code, go ahead!

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Professor David Malan and the CS50 team for creating such an amazing and accessible course. I would also like to thank my classmates and the CS50 community for their support and collaboration in my learning. Enjoy!
